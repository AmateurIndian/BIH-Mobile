Hey! I am Kamila Karimli, a fourth year international student from Azerbaijan, majoring in Management. I have been part of the BIH family as of last year. Currently, I am the secretary of BIH, meaning if you have any events you would like to organize, do contact me so that we can work together to realize your ideas!
