Hello! My name is Lazifa and I am a fourth year International Relations student from Azerbaijan. I have been part of this incredible club since day one as one of the founders and have now held the honorable title of president of Bilkent International House for two consecutive years. I hope that our club and team keeps expanding, serving as an effective platform for international students to engage with Turkish students.
