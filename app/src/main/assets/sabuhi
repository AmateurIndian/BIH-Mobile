Hi guys, My name is Sabuhi Osmanov and I am a 3rd year Economics student. I am originally from Azerbaijan, but since I have spent more than half of my life abroad, I speak a few languages and have made friends from all over  the world, I consider myself a Global Citizen, which is the main reason  why I love Bilkent International House. The main advantage of the club  is that being part of this club is the easiest way of improving English  and making international friends at Bilkent University, so I invite everybody to join beautiful family that keeps on expanding.
