My name is Amna Kara and I’m a fourth year management student from Pakistan. I’ve been a part of BIH since its very inception and this is my second year as its treasurer. Bilkent and Turkey have a lot to offer so I hope you make the most of your time here. I look forward to working with you all and hope you have a great year!
