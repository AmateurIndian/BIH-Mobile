I'm Faraz Rafiq, a 3rd year business management student from Pakistan. I've been in Bilkent International house  ever since I came here and now I'm honoured to act as the vice president of this club. University in my opinion is all about personal growth and making life long friends and that's what I've achieved as part of this club here. Join the family and make your experience a memorable one. Hope to see all of you guys soon!
Cheers
