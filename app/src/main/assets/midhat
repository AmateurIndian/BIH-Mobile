Hi! I am a 3rd Year Management student from Pakistan and have been involved in the activities of BIH since freshman year. As a coordinator for the communications unit I work, alongside my team members, towards promoting the club's events and activities and building a more positive image of the club, so as to make it prominent amongst both international as well as Turkish students. Our aim is to foster and expand BIH's social media sites in the most creative ways possible. We always look forward to welcoming a host of ideas and backgrounds in our team.
